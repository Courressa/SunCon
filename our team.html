                    <h4>PROJECT MANAGER</h4>
                    <p>McBean's Drafting Service was registered in 2003, offering architectural drafting and
                        construction supervision services, then eventually evolved into McBean's Project
                        Management by August 2016.
                        This was as a result of us recognizing that potential home owners had great difficulties
                        navigating through the process of home and property ownership, especially members
                        of the diaspora, therefore we decided to operate an international construction project
                        management company in order to assist clients with all the processes necessary for property
                        acquisition, building construction and maintenance .
